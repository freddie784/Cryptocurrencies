# Cryptocurrencies
## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create an analysis of the current cryptocurrencies by utilizing unsupervised machine learning. The analysis looked at all tradable cryptocurrencies and their total coins that have been mined and supply. Using KMeans it was found that 4 groups of clusters were the best fit for the algorithm. The clusters were classified based on their proof type, algorithm, and the difference between how much has been mined and the supply. The next recommended analysis would be to look at values to see which classes would be best to invest in.
